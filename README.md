# Number-Guessing-Game
This is Python based game. It randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player's task is to guess that number within a limited number of attempts. With each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is higher/lower than the target. The player aims to minimize the number of attempts to win the game.
